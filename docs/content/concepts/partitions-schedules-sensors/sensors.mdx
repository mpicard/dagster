## Overview

Sensors are definitions in Dagster that allow you to instigate runs based on some external state change. For example, you can:

- Launch a run whenever a file appears in an s3 bucket
- Launch a run whenever another job materializes a specific asset
- Launch a run whenever an external system is down

A sensor defines an evaluation function that returns either:

- One or more <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> objects. Each run request launches a run.
- An optional <PyObject object="SkipReason"/>, which specifies a message which describes why no runs were requested.

The [Dagster Daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) runs each sensor evaluation function on a tight loop. If you are using sensors, make sure to follow the instructions on the [Dagster Daemon page](/deployment/dagster-daemon) for how to run your sensors.

## Defining a sensor

To define a sensor, use the <PyObject object="sensor" decorator /> decorator. The decorated function can optionally have a `context` as the first argument. The context is a <PyObject object="SensorEvaluationContext" />.

Let's say you have a job that logs a filename that is specified in the op configuration of the `process_file` op:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_job_marker endbefore=end_sensor_job_marker
from dagster import op, job


@op(config_schema={"filename": str})
def process_file(context):
    filename = context.op_config["filename"]
    context.log.info(filename)


@job
def log_file_job():
    process_file()
```

You can write a sensor that watches for new files in a specific directory and `yields` a `RunRequest` for each new file in the directory. By default, this sensor runs every 30 seconds.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_directory_sensor_marker endbefore=end_directory_sensor_marker
import os
from dagster import sensor, RunRequest


@sensor(job=log_file_job)
def my_directory_sensor():
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            yield RunRequest(
                run_key=filename,
                run_config={
                    "ops": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}
                },
            )
```

This sensor iterates through all the files in `MY_DIRECTORY` and `yields` a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> for each file. Note that despite the `yield` syntax, the function will run to completion before any runs are submitted.

To write a sensor that materializes assets, you can [build a job that materializes assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#building-jobs-that-materialize-assets):

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_asset_job_sensor_marker endbefore=end_asset_job_sensor_marker
asset_job = define_asset_job("asset_job", "*")


@sensor(job=asset_job)
def materializes_asset_sensor():
    yield RunRequest(...)
```

Once a sensor is added to a <PyObject object="repository"/> with the job it yields a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> for, it can be started and will start creating runs. You can start or stop sensors in Dagit, or by setting the default status to `DefaultSensorStatus.RUNNING` in code:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_running_in_code endbefore=end_running_in_code
@sensor(job=asset_job, default_status=DefaultSensorStatus.RUNNING)
def my_running_sensor():
    ...
```

If you manually start or stop a sensor in Dagit, that will override any default status that is set in code.

Once your sensor is started, if you're running the [dagster-daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) process as part of your deployment, the sensor will begin executing immediately, without needing to restart the dagster-daemon process.

## Idempotence and Cursors

When instigating runs based on external events, you usually want to run exactly one job run for each event. There are two ways to define your sensors to avoid creating duplicate runs for your events: using `run_key` and using a cursor.

### Idempotence using run keys

In the example sensor above, the <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> is constructed with a `run_key`.

```python
yield RunRequest(
    run_key=filename,
    run_config={"ops": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}},
)
```

Dagster guarantees that for a given sensor, at most one run is created for each <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> with a unique `run_key`. If a sensor yields a new run request with a previously used `run_key`, Dagster skips processing the new run request.

In the example, a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> is requested for each file during _every_ sensor evaluation. Therefore, for a given sensor evaluation, there already exists a `RunRequest` with a `run_key` for any file that existed during the previous sensor evaluation. Dagster skips processing duplicate run requests, so Dagster launches runs for only the files added since the last sensor evaluation. The result is exactly one run per file.

Run keys allow you to write sensor evaluation functions that declaratively describe what job runs should exist, and helps you avoid the need for more complex logic that manages state. However, when dealing with high-volume external events, some state-tracking optimizations might be necessary.

### Sensor optimizations using cursors

When writing a sensor that deals with high-volume events, it might not be feasible to `yield` a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> during every sensor evaluation. For example, you may have an `s3` storage bucket that contains thousands of files.

When writing a sensor for such event sources, you can maintain a cursor that limits the number of yielded run requests for previously processed events. The sensor context, provided to every sensor evaluation function, has a `cursor` property and a `update_cursor` method for sensors to track state across evaluations.

- `cursor`: A cursor field on <PyObject object="SensorEvaluationContext"/> that returns the last persisted cursor value from a previous evaluation.
- `update_cursor`: A method on <PyObject object="SensorEvaluationContext"/> that takes a string to persist and make available to future evaluations.

Here is a somewhat contrived example of our directory file sensor using a cursor for updated files.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_cursor_sensors_marker endbefore=end_cursor_sensors_marker
@sensor(job=log_file_job)
def my_directory_sensor_cursor(context):
    last_mtime = float(context.cursor) if context.cursor else 0

    max_mtime = last_mtime
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            fstats = os.stat(filepath)
            file_mtime = fstats.st_mtime
            if file_mtime <= last_mtime:
                continue

            # the run key should include mtime if we want to kick off new runs based on file modifications
            run_key = f"{filename}:{str(file_mtime)}"
            run_config = {"ops": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}}
            yield RunRequest(run_key=run_key, run_config=run_config)
            max_mtime = max(max_mtime, file_mtime)

    context.update_cursor(str(max_mtime))
```

For sensors that consume multiple event streams, you may need to serialize and deserialize a more complex data structure in and out of the cursor string to keep track of the sensor's progress over the multiple streams.

## Evaluation Interval

By default, the Dagster Daemon runs a sensor 30 seconds after that sensor's previous evaluation finishes executing. You can configure the interval using the `minimum_interval_seconds` argument on the <PyObject object="sensor" decorator/> decorator.

It's important to note that this interval represents a minimum interval _between_ runs of the sensor and not the exact frequency the sensor runs. If you have a sensor that takes 30 seconds to complete, but the `minimum_interval_seconds` is 5 seconds, the fastest Dagster Daemon will run the sensor is every 35 seconds. The `minimum_interval_seconds` only guarantees that the sensor is not evaluated more frequently than the given interval.

For example, here are two sensors that specify two different minimum intervals:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_interval_sensors_maker endbefore=end_interval_sensors_maker
@sensor(job=my_job, minimum_interval_seconds=30)
def sensor_A():
    yield RunRequest(run_key=None, run_config={})


@sensor(job=my_job, minimum_interval_seconds=45)
def sensor_B():
    yield RunRequest(run_key=None, run_config={})
```

These sensor definitions are short, so they run in less than a second. Therefore, you can expect these sensors to run consistently around every 30 and 45 seconds, respectively.

If a sensor evaluation function takes more than 60 seconds to return its results, the sensor evaluation will time out and the Dagster Daemon will move on to the next sensor without submitting any runs. This 60 second timeout only applies to the time it takes to run the sensor function, not to the execution time of the runs submitted by the sensor. To avoid timeouts, slower sensors can break up their work into chunks, using [cursors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors#sensor-optimizations-using-cursors) to let subsequent sensor calls pick up where the previous call left off.

## Skipping sensor evaluations

For debugging purposes, it is often useful to describe why a sensor might not yield any runs for a given evaluation. The sensor evaluation function can yield a <PyObject object="SkipReason" /> with a string description that will be displayed in Dagit.

For example, here is our directory sensor that now provides a SkipReason when no files are encountered:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_skip_sensors_marker endbefore=end_skip_sensors_marker
@sensor(job=log_file_job)
def my_directory_sensor_with_skip_reasons():
    has_files = False
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            yield RunRequest(
                run_key=filename,
                run_config={
                    "ops": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}
                },
            )
            has_files = True
    if not has_files:
        yield SkipReason(f"No files found in {MY_DIRECTORY}.")
```

## Testing sensors

To quickly preview what an existing sensor will generate when evaluated, you can run the CLI command `dagster sensor preview my_sensor_name`.

In order to unit test sensors, you can invoke the sensor directly. This will return all the run requests yielded by the sensor. The config obtained from these can be validated using the <PyObject object="validate_run_config" /> function.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_testing endbefore=end_sensor_testing
from dagster import validate_run_config


@sensor(job=log_file_job)
def sensor_to_test():
    yield RunRequest(
        run_key="foo",
        run_config={"ops": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": "foo"}}}},
    )


def test_sensor():
    for run_request in sensor_to_test():
        assert validate_run_config(log_file_job, run_request.run_config)
```

Notice that since we did not use the context argument in our sensor, we don't have to provide a context object. However, if we do in fact need the context object for our sensor, we can provide it via <PyObject object="build_sensor_context" />. Consider again the `my_directory_sensor_cursor` example.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_cursor_sensors_marker endbefore=end_cursor_sensors_marker
@sensor(job=log_file_job)
def my_directory_sensor_cursor(context):
    last_mtime = float(context.cursor) if context.cursor else 0

    max_mtime = last_mtime
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            fstats = os.stat(filepath)
            file_mtime = fstats.st_mtime
            if file_mtime <= last_mtime:
                continue

            # the run key should include mtime if we want to kick off new runs based on file modifications
            run_key = f"{filename}:{str(file_mtime)}"
            run_config = {"ops": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}}
            yield RunRequest(run_key=run_key, run_config=run_config)
            max_mtime = max(max_mtime, file_mtime)

    context.update_cursor(str(max_mtime))
```

This sensor makes use of the `context` argument, and thus to invoke it, we need to provide one.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_testing_with_context endbefore=end_sensor_testing_with_context
from dagster import build_sensor_context


def test_my_directory_sensor_cursor():
    context = build_sensor_context(cursor="0")
    for run_request in my_directory_sensor_cursor(context):
        assert validate_run_config(log_file_job, run_request.run_config)
```

## Logging in sensors <Experimental />

Any sensor can emit log messages during its evaluation function:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_logging endbefore=end_sensor_logging
@sensor(job=the_job)
def logs_then_skips(context):
    context.log.info("Logging from a sensor!")
    return SkipReason("Nothing to do")
```

These logs can be viewed in Dagit on the corresponding sensor page, after first enabling the "Experimental schedule/sensor logging view" option in "User Settings".

## Monitoring sensors in Dagit

<!--
    These images were generated by running

    ```
    cd dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/
    dagit -f sensors.py
    ```
 -->

You can monitor and operate sensors in Dagit. There are multiple views that help with observing sensor evaluations, skip reasons, and errors.

To view the sensors page, you can navigate to the "Sensors" tab from the [Repository page](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories#using-a-repository). Here you can start and stop sensors using the toggle.

<Image
alt="All Sensors"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors/all-sensors.png"
width={1982}
height={1400}
/>

If you click on any sensor, you can monitor all sensor evaluations on a timeline and view a table of runs launched by the sensor:

<Image
alt="Sensor A"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors/sensor-A.png"
width={1982}
height={1400}
/>

## Run status sensors

If you want to act on the status of a job run, Dagster provides a way to create a sensor that reacts to run statuses. You can use <PyObject object="run_status_sensor" /> with a specified <PyObject object="DagsterRunStatus" /> to decorate a function that will run when the given status occurs. This can be used to launch runs of other jobs, send alerts to a monitoring service on run failure, or report a run success.

Here is an example of a run status sensor that launches a run of `status_reporting_job` if a run is successful

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/run_status_run_requests.py startafter=start endbefore=end
@run_status_sensor(
    run_status=DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS,
    request_job=status_reporting_job,
)
def report_status_sensor(context):
    # this condition prevents the sensor from triggering status_reporting_job again after it succeeds
    if context.dagster_run.job_name != status_reporting_job.name:
        run_config = {
            "ops": {
                "status_report": {"config": {"job_name": context.dagster_run.job_name}}
            }
        }
        return RunRequest(run_key=None, run_config=run_config)
    else:
        return SkipReason("Don't report status of status_reporting_job")
```

`request_job` is the job that will be run when the `RunRequest` is returned.

Note that in `report_status_sensor` we conditionally return a RunRequest. This ensures that when `report_status_sensor` runs `status_reporting_job` it doesn't enter an infinite loop where the success of `status_reporting_job` triggers another run of `status_reporting_job`, which triggers another run, and so on.

Here is an example of a sensor that reports job success in a Slack message:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_success_sensor_marker endbefore=end_success_sensor_marker
from dagster import run_status_sensor, RunStatusSensorContext, DagsterRunStatus


@run_status_sensor(run_status=DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS)
def my_slack_on_run_success(context: RunStatusSensorContext):
    slack_client = WebClient(token=os.environ["SLACK_DAGSTER_ETL_BOT_TOKEN"])

    slack_client.chat_postMessage(
        channel="#alert-channel",
        message=f'Job "{context.dagster_run.job_name}" succeeded.',
    )
```

When a run status sensor is triggered by a job run but doesn't return anything, Dagster will report an event back to the run to indicate that the sensor ran.

Once you have written your sensor, you can add the sensor to a repository so it can be enabled and used the same as other sensors:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_repo_marker endbefore=end_repo_marker
from dagster import repository


@repository
def my_repository():
    return my_jobs + [my_slack_on_run_success]
```

### Run failure sensor

Dagster provides a set of special run status sensor decorators for defining sensors that monitor run failure events. You can use <PyObject object="run_failure_sensor" /> to decorate a function that will run when a run fails.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/run_status_run_requests.py startafter=start_job_failure endbefore=end_job_failure
@run_failure_sensor(request_job=status_reporting_job)
def report_failure_sensor(context):
    run_config = {
        "ops": {"status_report": {"config": {"job_name": context.dagster_run.job_name}}}
    }
    return RunRequest(run_key=None, run_config=run_config)
```

This run failure sensor sends a slack message when it runs:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_alert_sensor_marker endbefore=end_alert_sensor_marker
import os
from dagster import run_failure_sensor, RunFailureSensorContext
from slack_sdk import WebClient


@run_failure_sensor
def my_slack_on_run_failure(context: RunFailureSensorContext):
    slack_client = WebClient(token=os.environ["SLACK_DAGSTER_ETL_BOT_TOKEN"])

    slack_client.chat_postMessage(
        channel="#alert-channel",
        message=(
            f'Job "{context.dagster_run.job_name}" failed. Error:'
            f" {context.failure_event.message}"
        ),
    )
```

**Dagster also provides the following out-of-box run failure sensors:**

<PyObject module="dagster_slack" object="make_slack_on_run_failure_sensor" /> helps
you create a run failure sensor that will message a given Slack channel:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_slack_marker endbefore=end_slack_marker
from dagster_slack import make_slack_on_run_failure_sensor

slack_on_run_failure = make_slack_on_run_failure_sensor("#my_channel", os.getenv("MY_SLACK_TOKEN"))
```

<PyObject object="make_email_on_run_failure_sensor" /> helps you create a run failure
sensor that will send emails via the SMTP protocol:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_email_marker endbefore=end_email_marker
from dagster import make_email_on_run_failure_sensor


email_on_run_failure = make_email_on_run_failure_sensor(
    email_from="no-reply@example.com",
    email_password=os.getenv("ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD"),
    email_to=["xxx@example.com", "xyz@example.com"],
)
```

Besides, if you would like to set up success or failure handling policies on ops, you can find more information on the [Op Hooks](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-hooks) page.

### Cross repository run status sensors

Sometimes, you may want to monitor jobs in a repository other than the one where the sensor is defined. You can use special identifiers <PyObject object="RepositorySelector" /> and <PyObject object="JobSelector" /> to tell a run status sensor to monitor jobs in another repository:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_cross_repo_run_status_sensor endbefore=end_cross_repo_run_status_sensor
@run_status_sensor(
    monitored_jobs=[
        RepositorySelector(
            location_name="repository.location", repository_name="team_a_repository"
        )
    ],
    run_status=DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS,
)
def team_a_repo_sensor():
    # when any job in team_a_repository succeeds, this sensor will trigger
    send_slack_alert()


@run_failure_sensor(
    monitored_jobs=[
        JobSelector(
            location_name="repository.location",
            repository_name="team_a_repository",
            job_name="data_update",
        )
    ],
)
def team_a_data_update_failure_sensor():
    # when the data_update job in team_a_repository fails, this sensor will trigger
    send_slack_alert()
```

You can also monitor every job in your Dagster instance by specifying `monitor_all_repositories=True` on the sensor decorator. Note that `monitor_all_repositories` cannot be used along with jobs specified via `monitored_jobs`.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_instance_sensor endbefore=end_instance_sensor
@run_status_sensor(
    monitor_all_repositories=True,
    run_status=DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS,
)
def instance_sensor():
    # when any job in the Dagster instance succeeds, this sensor will trigger
    send_slack_alert()
```

## Testing run status sensors

As with other sensors, you can directly invoke run status sensors. However, the `context` provided via <PyObject object="run_status_sensor" /> and <PyObject object="run_failure_sensor" /> contain objects that are typically only available during run time. Below you'll find code snippets that demonstrate how to build the context so that you can directly invoke your function in unit tests. Feel free to copy the following into your unit tests.

If you had written a status sensor like this (assuming you implemented the function `email_alert` elsewhere)

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_simple_success_sensor endbefore=end_simple_success_sensor
@run_status_sensor(run_status=DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS)
def my_email_sensor(context: RunStatusSensorContext):
    message = f'Job "{context.dagster_run.job_name}" succeeded.'
    email_alert(message)
```

We can first write a simple job that will succeed

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_run_status_sensor_testing_with_context_setup endbefore=end_run_status_sensor_testing_with_context_setup
@op
def succeeds():
    return 1


@job
def my_job_succeeds():
    succeeds()
```

Then we can execute this job and pull the attributes we need to build the `context`. We provide a function <PyObject object="build_run_status_sensor_context" /> that will return the correct context object

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_run_status_sensor_testing_marker endbefore=end_run_status_sensor_testing_marker
# execute the job
instance = DagsterInstance.ephemeral()
result = my_job_succeeds.execute_in_process(instance=instance)

# retrieve the DagsterRun
dagster_run = result.dagster_run

# retrieve a success event from the completed execution
dagster_event = result.get_job_success_event()

# create the context
run_status_sensor_context = build_run_status_sensor_context(
    sensor_name="my_email_sensor",
    dagster_instance=instance,
    dagster_run=dagster_run,
    dagster_event=dagster_event,
)

# run the sensor
my_email_sensor(run_status_sensor_context)
```

We have provided convenience functions <PyObject object="ExecuteInProcessResult" method="get_job_success_event" /> and <PyObject object="ExecuteInProcessResult" method="get_job_failure_event" /> for retrieving `DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS` and `DagsterRunStatus.FAILURE` events, respectively. If you have a run status sensor triggered on another status, you can retrieve all events from `result` and filter based on your event type.

We can use the same pattern to build the context for <PyObject object="run_failure_sensor" />. If we wanted to test this run failure sensor

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_simple_fail_sensor endbefore=end_simple_fail_sensor
@run_failure_sensor
def my_email_failure_sensor(context: RunFailureSensorContext):
    message = (
        f'Job "{context.dagster_run.job_name}" failed. Error:'
        f" {context.failure_event.message}"
    )
    email_alert(message)
```

We first need to make a simple job that will fail

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_failure_sensor_testing_with_context_setup endbefore=end_failure_sensor_testing_with_context_setup
from dagster import op, job


@op
def fails():
    raise Exception("failure!")


@job
def my_job_fails():
    fails()
```

Then we can execute the job and create our context

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_alert_sensor_testing_with_context_marker endbefore=end_alert_sensor_testing_with_context_marker
from dagster import DagsterInstance, build_run_status_sensor_context

# execute the job
instance = DagsterInstance.ephemeral()
result = my_job_fails.execute_in_process(instance=instance, raise_on_error=False)

# retrieve the DagsterRun
dagster_run = result.dagster_run

# retrieve a failure event from the completed job execution
dagster_event = result.get_job_failure_event()

# create the context
run_failure_sensor_context = build_run_status_sensor_context(
    sensor_name="my_email_failure_sensor",
    dagster_instance=instance,
    dagster_run=dagster_run,
    dagster_event=dagster_event,
).for_run_failure()

# run the sensor
my_email_failure_sensor(run_failure_sensor_context)
```

Note the additional function call <PyObject object="RunStatusSensorContext" method="for_run_failure" /> after creating the `context`. The `context` provided by <PyObject object="run_failure_sensor" /> is a subclass of the context provided by <PyObject object="run_status_sensor" /> and can be built using this additional call.

## Examples

### S3 sensors

For jobs that should initiate new runs for new paths in an s3 bucket, the `dagster-aws` package provides the useful helper function `get_s3_keys`.

Here is an example of a sensor that listens to a particular s3 bucket `my_s3_bucket`:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_s3_sensors_marker endbefore=end_s3_sensors_marker
from dagster_aws.s3.sensor import get_s3_keys


@sensor(job=my_job)
def my_s3_sensor(context):
    since_key = context.cursor or None
    new_s3_keys = get_s3_keys("my_s3_bucket", since_key=since_key)
    if not new_s3_keys:
        return SkipReason("No new s3 files found for bucket my_s3_bucket.")
    last_key = new_s3_keys[-1]
    run_requests = [RunRequest(run_key=s3_key, run_config={}) for s3_key in new_s3_keys]
    context.update_cursor(last_key)
    return run_requests
```

### Using resources in sensors

If you want to use resources within your sensor, you can use the <PyObject object="build_resources"/> API to perform the initialization.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_build_resources_example endbefore=end_build_resources_example
from dagster import resource, build_resources, sensor


@resource
def the_credentials():
    ...


@resource(required_resource_keys={"credentials"})
def the_db_connection(init_context):
    get_the_db_connection(init_context.resources.credentials)


@sensor(job=the_job)
def uses_db_connection():
    with build_resources(
        {"db_connection": the_db_connection, "credentials": the_credentials}
    ) as resources:
        conn = resources.db_connection
        ...
```

If a resource you want to initialize has dependencies on other resources, those can be included in the dictionary passed to <PyObject object="build_resources"/>. For more in-depth usage, check out the [Initializing Resources Outside of Execution](/concepts/resources#initializing-resources-outside-of-execution) section.
