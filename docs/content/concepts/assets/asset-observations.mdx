# Asset Observations

An asset observation is an event that records metadata about a given asset. Unlike asset materializations, asset observations do not signify that an asset has been mutated.

## Relevant APIs

| Name                                   | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> | Dagster event indicating that an asset's metadata has been recorded. |
| <PyObject object="AssetKey" />         | A unique identifier for a particular external asset.                 |

## Overview

<PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> events are used record metadata in Dagster
about a given asset. Asset observation events can be logged at runtime within ops
and assets. An asset must be defined using the <PyObject
object="asset"
decorator
/> decorator or have existing materializations in order for its observations to be
displayed.

## Logging an AssetObservation from an Op

To make Dagster aware that we have recorded metadata about an asset, we can log an <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> event from within an op. To do this, we use the method <PyObject object="OpExecutionContext" method="log_event" /> on the context:

```python file=/concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_observation_asset_marker_0 endbefore=end_observation_asset_marker_0
from dagster import AssetObservation, op


@op
def observation_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    context.log_event(
        AssetObservation(asset_key="observation_asset", metadata={"num_rows": len(df)})
    )
    return 5
```

We should now see an observation event in the event log when we execute this asset.

### Attaching Metadata to an AssetObservation

There are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with an observation event, all through the <PyObject object="MetadataEntry" /> class. Each observation event optionally takes a dictionary of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log and the [Asset Details](/concepts/dagit/dagit#asset-details) page. Check our API docs for <PyObject object="MetadataEntry" /> for more details on the types of event metadata available.

```python file=concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_observation_asset_marker_2 endbefore=end_observation_asset_marker_2
from dagster import AssetObservation, MetadataValue, op


@op
def observes_dataset_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    context.log_event(
        AssetObservation(
            asset_key="my_dataset",
            metadata={
                "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
                "path": MetadataValue.path(remote_storage_path),
                "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url(
                    "http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"
                ),
                "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
            },
        )
    )
    context.log_event(AssetMaterialization(asset_key="my_dataset"))
    return remote_storage_path
```

In the [Asset Details](/concepts/dagit/dagit#asset-details) page, we can see observations in the Asset Activity table.

### Specifying a partition for an AssetObservation

If you are observing a single slice of an asset (e.g. a single day's worth of data on a larger table), rather than mutating or creating it entirely, you can indicate this to Dagster by including the `partition` argument on the object.

```python file=/concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_partitioned_asset_observation endbefore=end_partitioned_asset_observation
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, op


@op(config_schema={"date": str})
def partitioned_dataset_op(context):
    partition_date = context.op_config["date"]
    df = read_df_for_date(partition_date)
    context.log_event(
        AssetObservation(asset_key="my_partitioned_dataset", partition=partition_date)
    )
    return df
```

### Observable source assets

<PyObject object="SourceAsset" /> objects may have a user-defined _observation function_
that returns a <PyObject object="LogicalVersion" />. Whenever the observation
function is run, an `AssetObservation` will be generated for the source asset
and tagged with the returned logical version. The logical version is used in
staleness calculations for downstream assets.

The <PyObject object="observable_source_asset" /> decorator provides a convenient way to define source assets with observation functions. The below observable source asset takes a file hash and returns it as the logical version. Every time you run the observation function, a new observation will be generated with this hash set as logical version.

```python file=/concepts/assets/observable_source_assets.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from hashlib import sha256
from dagster import LogicalVersion, observable_source_asset


@observable_source_asset
def foo_source_asset(_context):
    content = read_some_file()
    hash_sig = sha256()
    hash_sig.update(bytearray(content, "utf8"))
    return LogicalVersion(hash_sig.hexdigest())
```

When the file content changes, the hash and therefore the logical version will change-- this will notify Dagster that downstream assets derived from an older value (i.e. a different logical version) of this source asset are stale.

Source asset observations can be triggered via the "Observe sources" button in the Dagit graph explorer view. Note that this button will only be visible if at least one source asset in the current graph defines an observation function.
