</Note>

An **asset** is an object in persistent storage, such as a table, file, or persisted machine learning model. A **software-defined asset** is a Dagster object that couples an asset to the function and upstream assets that are used to produce its contents.

Software-defined assets enable a declarative approach to data management, in which code is the source of truth on what data assets should exist and how those assets are computed.

A software-defined asset includes the following:

- An <PyObject object="AssetKey" />, which is a handle for referring to the asset.
- A set of upstream asset keys, which refer to assets that the contents of the software-defined asset are derived from.
- An [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops), which is a function responsible for computing the contents of the asset from its upstream dependencies.

  **Note**: A crucial distinction between software-defined assets and [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) is that software-defined assets know about their dependencies, while ops do not. Ops aren't connected to dependencies until they're placed inside a [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).

**Materializing** an asset is the act of running its op and saving the results to persistent storage. You can initiate materializations from [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit) or by invoking Python APIs. By default, assets are materialized to pickle files on your local filesystem, but materialization behavior is fully customizable using [IO managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#applying-io-managers-to-assets). It's possible to materialize an asset in multiple storage environments, such as production and staging.

## Defining assets

- [Basic software-defined assets](#a-basic-software-defined-asset)
- [Assets with dependencies](#assets-with-dependencies)
- [Graph-backed assets and multi-assets](#graph-backed-assets-and-multi-assets)
- [Accessing asset context](#asset-context)
- [Configuring assets](#asset-configuration)

### A basic software-defined asset

The easiest way to create a software-defined asset is with the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator.

```python file=/concepts/assets/basic_asset_definition.py
from dagster import asset


@asset
def my_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

By default, the name of the decorated function, `my_asset`, is used as the asset key. The decorated function forms the asset's op: it's responsible for producing the asset's contents. The asset in this example doesn't depend on any other assets.

### Assets with dependencies

Software-defined assets can depend on other software-defined assets. In this section, we'll show you how to define:

- [Basic asset dependencies](#defining-basic-dependencies)
- [Explicit asset dependencies](#defining-explicit-dependencies)
- [External asset dependencies](#defining-external-asset-dependencies)

#### Defining basic dependencies

The easiest way to define an asset dependency is to include an upstream asset name as an argument to the decorated function.

In the following example, `downstream_asset` depends on `upstream_asset`. That means that the contents of `upstream_asset` are provided to the function that computes the contents of `downstream_asset`.

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_dependency.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]
```

#### Defining explicit dependencies

If defining dependencies by matching argument names to upstream asset names feels too magical for your tastes, you can also define dependencies in a more explicit way:

```python file=/concepts/assets/explicit_string_asset_dependency.py
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset(ins={"upstream": AssetIn("upstream_asset")})
def downstream_asset(upstream):
    return upstream + [4]
```

In this case, `ins={"upstream": AssetIn("upstream_asset")}` declares that the contents of the asset with the key `upstream_asset` will be provided to the function argument named `upstream`.

Asset keys can also be provided to <PyObject object="AssetIn" /> to explicitly identify the asset. For example:

```python file=/concepts/assets/explicit_asset_dependency_asset_keys.py
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


# If the upstream key has a single segment, you can specify it with a string:
@asset(ins={"upstream": AssetIn(key="upstream_asset")})
def downstream_asset(upstream):
    return upstream + [4]


# If it has multiple segments, you can provide a list:
@asset(ins={"upstream": AssetIn(key=["some_db_schema", "upstream_asset"])})
def another_downstream_asset(upstream):
    return upstream + [10]
```

#### Defining external asset dependencies

Software-defined assets frequently depend on assets that are generated elsewhere. Using <PyObject object="SourceAsset" />, you can include these external assets and allow your other assets to depend on them.

For example:

```python file=/concepts/assets/source_asset.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import AssetKey, SourceAsset, asset

my_source_asset = SourceAsset(key=AssetKey("a_source_asset"))


@asset
def my_derived_asset(a_source_asset):
    return a_source_asset + [4]
```

**Note**: The source asset's asset key must be provided as the argument to downstream assets. In the previous example, the asset key is `a_source_asset` and not `my_source_asset`.

You can also re-use assets across repositories by including them as source assets:

```python file=/concepts/assets/cross_repository_asset.py
from dagster import AssetKey, SourceAsset, asset, repository


@asset
def repository_a_asset():
    return 5


@repository
def repository_a():
    return [repository_a_asset]


repository_a_source_asset = SourceAsset(key=AssetKey("repository_a_asset"))


@asset
def repository_b_asset(repository_a_asset):
    return repository_a_asset + 6


@repository
def repository_b():
    return [repository_b_asset, repository_a_source_asset]
```

Using source assets has a few advantages over having the code inside of an asset's op load the data:

- **Dagit can show asset lineage that includes the source assets**. If a different asset definition in a different repository in the same [workspace](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces) has the same asset key as a <PyObject object="SourceAsset" />, Dagit can represent the asset lineage across those repositories.
- **Dagster can use data-loading code factored into an <PyObject object="IOManager" /> to load the contents of the source asset**.
- **Asset dependencies can be written in a consistent way,** independent of whether they're downstream from a source asset or a derived asset. This makes it easy to swap out a source asset for a derived asset and vice versa.

#### Non-argument dependencies

Alternatively, you can define dependencies where data from an upstream asset doesn’t need to be loaded by Dagster to compute a downstream asset's output. When used, `non_argument_deps` defines the dependency between assets but doesn’t pass data through Dagster.

Consider the following example:

1. `upstream_asset` creates a new table (`sugary_cereals`) by selecting records from the `cereals` table
2. `downstream_asset` then creates a new table (`shopping_list`) by selecting records from `sugary_cereals`

```python file=/concepts/assets/non_argument_deps.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import asset


@asset
def upstream_asset() -> None:
    execute_query("CREATE TABLE sugary_cereals AS SELECT * FROM cereals")


@asset(non_argument_deps={"upstream_asset"})
def downstream_asset() -> None:
    execute_query("CREATE TABLE shopping_list AS SELECT * FROM sugary_cereals")
```

In this example, Dagster doesn’t need to load data from `upstream_asset` to successfully compute the `downstream_asset`. While `downstream_asset` does depend on `upstream_asset`, the key difference with `non_argument_deps` is that data isn’t being passed between the functions. Specifically, the data from the `sugary_cereals` table isn't being passed as an argument to `downstream_asset`.

### Graph-backed assets and multi-assets

If you'd like to define more complex assets, Dagster offers augmented software-defined asset abstractions:

- [Multi-assets](/concepts/assets/multi-assets): A set of software-defined assets that are all updated by the same [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) or [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).
- [Graph-backed assets](/concepts/assets/graph-backed-assets): An asset whose computations are separated into multiple [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) that are combined to build a [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs). If the graph outputs multiple assets, the graph-backed asset is a [multi-asset](/concepts/assets/multi-assets).

### Asset context

Since a software-defined asset contains an op, all the typical functionality of an op - like the use of [resources](/concepts/resources) and [configuration](#asset-configuration) - is available to an asset. Supplying the `context` parameter provides access to system information for the op, for example:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_w_context.py startafter=start_w_context endbefore=end_w_context
@asset(required_resource_keys={"api"})
def my_asset(context):
    # fetches contents of an asset
    return context.resources.api.fetch_table("my_asset")
```

### Asset configuration

Like ops, configuration is also supported for assets. Configuration is accessible through the asset context at runtime and can be used to specify behavior. Note that asset configuration behaves the same as configuration for ops.

For example, the following asset queries an API endpoint defined through configuration:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_config.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
@asset(config_schema={"api_endpoint": str})
def my_configurable_asset(context):
    api_endpoint = context.op_config["api_endpoint"]
    data = requests.get(f"{api_endpoint}/data").json()
    return data
```

Refer to the [Config schema documentation](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) for more configuration info and examples.

### Conditional materialization

In some cases, an asset may not need to be updated in storage each time the decorated function is executed. In this case you can use the `output_required` parameter along with `yield` syntax to invoke this behavior. If the `output_required` parameter is set to `False`, you may indicate to the Dagster framework that no data should be persisted to storage by not yielding an output from your computation function. If an output is not emitted during computation, no asset materialization event will be created, the I/O manager will not be invoked, downstream assets will not be materialized, and asset sensors monitoring the asset will not trigger.

```python file=/concepts/assets/conditional_materialization.py startafter=start_conditional endbefore=end_conditional
@asset(output_required=False)
def may_not_materialize():
    # to simulate an asset that may not always materialize.
    random.seed()
    if random.randint(1, 10) < 5:
        yield Output([1, 2, 3, 4])


@asset
def downstream(may_not_materialize):
    # will not run when may_not_materialize doesn't materialize the asset
    return may_not_materialize + [5]
```

### Asset code versions

Assets may be assigned a `code_version`. Versions let you help Dagster track what assets are stale and avoid performing redundant computation.

```python file=/concepts/assets/code_versions.py startafter=start_single_asset endbefore=end_single_asset
@asset(code_version="1")
def asset_with_version():
    return 100
```

When an asset with a code version is materialized, the generated `AssetMaterialization` is tagged with the version. An asset that has a different code version than the code version used for its most recent materialization will be considered stale. Any assets downstream of a stale asset are also considered stale.

Multi-assets may assign different code versions for each of their outputs:

```python file=/concepts/assets/code_versions.py startafter=start_multi_asset endbefore=end_multi_asset
@multi_asset(
    outs={
        "a": AssetOut(code_version="1"),
        "b": AssetOut(code_version="2"),
    }
)
def multi_asset_with_versions():
    yield Output(100, "a")
    yield Output(200, "b")
```

Just as with regular assets, these versions are attached to the `AssetMaterialization` objects for each of the constituent assets and accounted for when determining asset staleness.

## Viewing and materializing assets in Dagit

Once you've defined a set of assets, you can:

- [Load them into Dagit](#loading-assets-into-dagit)
- [View them in Dagit](#viewing-assets-in-dagit)
- [Materialize an ad-hoc set of them in Dagit](#materializing-assets-in-dagit)
- [Build a job](#building-jobs-that-materialize-assets), which materializes a fixed selection of the assets, and can be put on a schedule or sensor

### Loading assets into Dagit

To view and materialize assets in Dagit, you can point it at a module that contains asset definitions or lists of asset definitions as module-level attributes:

    dagit -m module_with_assets

If you want Dagit to contain both assets and [jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) that target the assets, you can place the assets and jobs together inside a [repository](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories).

### Viewing assets in Dagit

- [All assets](#all-assets)
- [Details for an asset](#asset-details)
- [Dependency graph](#dependency-graph)
- [Upstream changes](#upstream-changed-indicator)

#### All assets

To view a list of all your assets, click **Assets** in the top-right corner of the page. This opens the Assets page:

<Image
alt="Assets page"
src="/images/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets/catalog.png"
width={2662}
height={1506}
/>

#### Asset Details

View the Asset Details page for an asset by clicking on its name:

<Image
alt="Asset Details"
src="/images/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets/details.png"
width={2662}
height={1506}
/>

#### Dependency graph

To view a graph of all assets and their dependencies, you can:

- Click the graph icon to the upper-left of the Asset Catalog
- Click **View in Graph** on any asset

<Image
alt="Asset Graph"
src="/images/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets/graph.png"
width={2662}
height={1506}
/>

#### Upstream changed indicator

On occasion, you might see an **upstream changed** indicator on an asset in the dependency graph or on the Asset Details page:

<Image
alt="Asset Graph with an upstream changed indicator"
src="/images/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets/upstream-changed.png"
width={1556}
height={790}
/>

This occurs when a downstream asset's last materialization took place **earlier than the asset it depends on.** Dagit displays this alert to notify you that the contents of an asset may be stale. For example:

- `comments` is upstream of `comment_stories`
- `comment_stories` depends on `comments`
- `comment_stories` was last materialized on February 25 at **5:30PM**
- `comments` was last materialized on February 25 at **7:05PM**

In this case, the contents of `comment_stories` may be outdated, as the most recent data from `comments` wasn't used to compute them.

You can resolve this issue by re-materializing the downstream asset. This will re-compute the contents with the most recent data/changes to its upstream dependency.

<Note>
  Currently, the <strong>upstream changed</strong> indicator won't display in
  the following scenarios:
  <ul>
    <li>The upstream asset is in another repository or job</li>
    <li>The assets are partitioned</li>
  </ul>
</Note>

### Materializing assets in Dagit

In Dagit, you can launch runs that materialize assets by:

- Navigating to the [**Asset Details** page](#asset-details) for the asset and click the **Materialize** button in the upper right corner.
- Navigating to the graph view of the [**Assets** page](#all-assets) and clicking the **Materialize** button in the upper right corner. You can also click on assets to collect a subset to materialize.

---

## Building jobs that materialize assets

Jobs that target assets can materialize a fixed selection of assets each time they run and be placed on schedules and sensors. Refer to the [Jobs documentation](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs#from-software-defined-assets) for more info and examples.

---

## Grouping assets

To help keep your assets tidy, you can organize them into groups. Grouping assets by project, concept, and so on simplifies [keeping track of them in Dagit](#viewing-asset-groups-in-dagit). Each asset is assigned to a single group, which by default is called "default".

- [Assigning assets to groups](#assigning-assets-to-groups)
- [Viewing asset groups in Dagit](#viewing-asset-groups-in-dagit)

### Assigning assets to groups

In Dagster, there are two ways to assign assets to groups:

- [By specifying a group name on an individual asset](#on-individual-assets)
- [By using the group_name argument when calling `load_assets_from_package_module`](#from-assets-in-a-sub-module) (**recommended**)

By default, assets that aren't assigned to a group will be placed in a group named `default`. Use Dagit to [view these assets](#viewing-asset-groups-in-dagit).

#### On individual assets

Assets can also be given groups on an individual basis by specifying an argument when creating the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_group_argument.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
@asset(group_name="cereal_assets")
def nabisco_cereals():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

#### From assets in a sub-module

**This recommended approach** constructs a group of assets from a specified module in your project. Using the `load_assets_from_package_module` function, you can import all assets in a module and apply a grouping:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_group_module.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from my_package import cereal

cereal_assets = load_assets_from_package_module(
    cereal,
    group_name="cereal_assets",
)
```

If any of the assets in the module already has a `group_name` explicitly set on it, you'll encounter a `Group name already exists on assets` error.

### Viewing asset groups in Dagit

To view your asset groups in Dagit, open the left navigation by clicking the **menu icon in the top left corner**. As asset groups are grouped in repositories, you may need to open a repository to view its asset groups:

<Image
alt="Asset Groups in Dagit left navigation"
src="/images/concepts/assets/asset-groups-in-sidenav.png"
width={903}
height={454}
/>

Click the asset group to open a dependency graph for all assets in the group:

<Image
alt="Dependency graph for an asset group"
src="/images/concepts/assets/asset-group-dependency-graph.png"
width={1899}
height={945}
/>

---

## Testing

When writing unit tests, you can treat the function decorated by `@asset` as a regular Python function.

Consider a simple asset with no upstream dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_simple_asset endbefore=end_simple_asset
@asset
def my_simple_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

When writing a unit test, you can directly invoke the decorated function:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_simple_asset endbefore=end_test_simple_asset
def test_my_simple_asset():
    result = my_simple_asset()
    assert result == [1, 2, 3]
```

If you have an asset with upstream dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_more_complex_asset endbefore=end_more_complex_asset
@asset
def more_complex_asset(my_simple_asset):
    return my_simple_asset + [4, 5, 6]
```

You can manually provide values for those dependencies in your unit test. This allows you to test assets in isolation from one another:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_more_complex_asset endbefore=end_test_more_complex_asset
def test_more_complex_asset():
    result = more_complex_asset([0])
    assert result == [0, 4, 5, 6]
```

If you use a context object in your function, `@asset` will provide the correct context during execution. When writing a unit test, you can mock it with <PyObject object="build_op_context" />. You can use <PyObject object="build_op_context" /> to generate the `context` object because under the hood the function decorated by `@asset` is an op.

Consider this asset that uses a resource:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_with_context_asset endbefore=end_with_context_asset
@asset
def uses_context(context):
    return context.resources.foo
```

When writing a unit test, use <PyObject object="build_op_context" /> to mock the `context` and provide values for testing:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_with_context_asset endbefore=end_test_with_context_asset
def test_uses_context():
    context = build_op_context(resources={"foo": "bar"})
    result = uses_context(context)
    assert result == "bar"
```

---

## Loading asset values outside of Dagster runs

It's sometimes useful to load an asset as a Python object outside of a Dagster run, e.g. if you want to do exploratory data analysis on it inside a Jupyter notebook. For this, you can use <PyObject object="RepositoryDefinition" method="load_asset_value" />:

```python file=/concepts/assets/load_asset_values.py startafter=single_asset_start_marker endbefore=single_asset_end_marker dedent=4
@repository
def repo():
    return [load_assets_from_current_module()]

asset1_value = repo.load_asset_value(AssetKey("asset1"))
```

If you want to load the values of multiple assets, it's more efficient to use <PyObject object="RepositoryDefinition" method="get_asset_value_loader" />, which avoids spinning up resources separately for each asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/load_asset_values.py startafter=multiple_asset_start_marker endbefore=multiple_asset_end_marker dedent=4
with repo.get_asset_value_loader() as loader:
    asset1_value = loader.load_asset_value(AssetKey("asset1"))
    asset2_value = loader.load_asset_value(AssetKey("asset2"))
```

---

## Examples

- [Multi-component asset keys](#multi-component-asset-keys)
- [Recording materialization metadata](#recording-materialization-metadata)
- [Attaching definition metadata](#attaching-definition-metadata)

### Multi-component asset keys

Assets are often objects in systems with hierarchical namespaces, like filesystems. Because of this, it often makes sense for an asset key to be a list of strings, instead of just a single string. To define an asset with a multi-part asset key, use the `key_prefix` argument-- this can be either a list of strings or a single string with segments delimited by "/". The full asset key is formed by prepending the `key_prefix` to the asset name (which defaults to the name of the decorated function).

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_component_asset_key.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


@asset(key_prefix=["one", "two", "three"])
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset(ins={"upstream_asset": AssetIn(key_prefix="one/two/three")})
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]
```

### Recording materialization metadata

Dagster supports attaching arbitrary [metadata](/\_apidocs/ops#dagster.MetadataEntry) to asset materializations. This metadata will be displayed on the "Activity" tab of the "Asset Details" page in Dagit. If it's numeric, it will be plotted. To attach metadata, your asset's op can return an <PyObject object="Output" /> object that contains the output value and a dictionary of metadata:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_materialization_metadata.py
from pandas import DataFrame

from dagster import Output, asset


@asset
def table1() -> Output[DataFrame]:
    df = DataFrame({"col1": [1, 2], "col2": [3, 4]})
    return Output(df, metadata={"num_rows": df.shape[0]})
```

Sometimes it's useful to record the same metadata for all assets that are stored in the same way. E.g. if you have a set of assets that are all stored on a filesystem, you might want to record the number of bytes they occupy on disk every time one is materialized. You can achieve this by [recording metadata from an I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#recording-metadata-from-an-io-manager) that's shared by the assets.

### Attaching definition metadata

Dagster supports attaching arbitrary [metadata](/\_apidocs/ops#dagster.MetadataEntry) to asset definitions. This metadata will be displayed on the "Definition" tab of the "Asset Details" page in Dagit. This is useful for metadata that describes how the asset should be handled, rather than metadata describes the contents that were produced by a particular run.

To attach metadata, supply a `metadata` dictionary to the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_definition_metadata.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
@asset(metadata={"owner": "alice@mycompany.com", "priority": "high"})
def my_asset():
    return 5
```
