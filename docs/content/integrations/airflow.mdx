# Using Dagster with Airflow

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/with_airflow" />

The [`dagster-airflow`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-airflow) package provides interoperability between Dagster and Airflow. The main scenarios for using the Dagster Airflow integration are:

- You want to do a lift-and-shift migration of all your existing Airflow DAGs into Dagster
- You want to run Dagster Jobs on your existing Airflow Infrastructure
- You want to orchestrate Dagster JobRuns from Airflow

This integration is designed to help support users who have existing Airflow usage and are looking to explore using Dagster.

## Terminology

The first thing you need to do when approaching Dagster from Airflow is to learn the terminology. While the two systems have significant differences, there are some overlapping concepts. Here’s a quick cheat sheet to help you get started.
